## 1. Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions

## 2. Project Motivation

I have looked into four questions of the [Stackoverflow Developer Survey 2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) and formulated and performed my analysis based on job attracting factors for small and mid-size as well as large organisations. The questions that I have explored were related to three job attracting factors upon which my research questions were based. For the analysis I used three datasets: whole dataset, dataset on small and mid-size enterprises and dataset on large enterprises.

Developers were asked to select from 11 factors, three most influential factors assuming they have two jobs offers, with the same compensations, benefits and locations. The most important factor after analysing the three datasets separately was: **Languages, frameworks and other technologies they will work with**. Hence, I used this information to set the bases for my second research question. Here I mainly explore tech tools developers prefer using in 2021.

The first research question compares the percentage differences between the jobs attracting factors for both small and mid-size and large enterprises.The factor **Financial performance or funding status of the company or organization** was centred interms of percentage differences for the two organisational types. I used this information as an orientation for my formulation of research questions 3 and 4, in which I estimated salary for developers by using supervised machine learning.

## 3. File Descriptions 

There is one notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in explaining the individual steps.
There is an additional .py file that contains the necessary methods to explore the dataset and create visualizations without resorting to code repetitions.

## 4. Results 
  
The results of this analysis were selected for publication at the Startup-Medium [here](https://paul-dzitse.medium.com/)

Some of graphical abstracts can be seen below.
